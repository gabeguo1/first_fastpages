[fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) automates the process of creating blog posts via GitHub Actions, so you don't have to fuss with conversion scripts.  A full list of features can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages).  

You can edit the `index.html` file to change this content.
